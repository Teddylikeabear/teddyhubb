SEO (short for search engine optimization) is the practice of tweaking your website so that it ranks higher on search engines like Google.
SEO tools provide data and alerts about the overall health and success of your website.
They help uncover areas of opportunity and identify weaknesses or issues that may prevent you from ranking and earning visibility in the SERPs.
